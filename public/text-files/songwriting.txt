I'm the guitarist and second vocalist of the symphonic metal band called Children of the Frost. I'm also the main songwriter for the band - I compose most of the music, write a majority of the lyrics and take part in the arrangement process. I also write a variety of other songs in styles that are outside of what Children of the Frost typically plays.
