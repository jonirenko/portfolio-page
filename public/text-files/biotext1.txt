My name is Joni Renko. I am an IT student currently based in Oulu, Finland. My degree programme is Business Information Systems, and I consider web developement a particularily strong skill in my arsenal. I, of course, have other interests when it comes to the IT field, such as software developement and cyber security, and I'm working on expanding my knowledge and skills in those areas as well.
