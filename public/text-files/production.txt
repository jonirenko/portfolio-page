I've been a hobbyist music producer since 2015 with a strong focus on rock and heavy metal. I can record both live instruments and simulated ones and I'm able to mix and master the tracks according to the style of music I'm producing. For the majority of my productions I use Cockos Reaper and a variety of plugins.
